# Flutter: Working with widgets batch one
### Absorb Pointer : 
This widget will disable the touch functionality for it’s child widgets. Suppose if we mention a column or container widget as a child to Absorb Pointer widget, then we won’t get any touch events inside that column or container, even button clicks also don’t work. We need to set absorbing property to true, to achieve this.

### Ignore Pointer : 
This widget will disable the touch functionality for it’s child widgets. Suppose if we mention a column or container widget as a child to Absorb Pointer widget, then we won’t get any touch events inside that column or container, even button clicks also don’t work. We need to set ignoring property to true, to achieve this.
###### The difference between absorb and Ignore is, Ignore pointer is invisible to hit testing and Absorb Pointer is visible to hit testing.
